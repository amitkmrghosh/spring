Infrastructure components are low-level re-usable abstractions that
help with optimisation or common ETL-style problems.  Optimisations
include repeating an operation automatically until a policy determines
that the iteration is over.  Combining this with a transaction
boundary optimises throughput by widening the transaction and sharing
the resources amongst all the operations.  ETL support includes
input/output operations like flat file parsing, and transaction
synchronisations to make file access pseudo-transactional (e.g. return
to last good line if a transaction rolls back).  There are also useful
abstractions for generic input and output.
